# Real AI Engineering

Welcome to **Real AI Engineering** – a collective of engineers, researchers, and enthusiasts building the next generation of AI-powered agents and automation systems.

## Mission

We believe in open collaboration and the democratization of AI. Our mission is to develop, share, and promote best practices for constructing intelligent agents that can reason, plan, and act in the real world. We curate tools, frameworks, and research to accelerate innovation and help individuals and organizations harness the power of large language models and multi-agent systems.

## What We Do

- **Curated resources:** We maintain repositories like [awesome-ai-agents](https://github.com/Real-AI-Engineering/awesome-ai-agents) that collect and categorize the best open-source frameworks, papers, and tutorials for AI agent development.
- **Community Projects:** We experiment with multi-agent orchestration, memory management, planning algorithms, and integration with external tools and APIs.
- **Education & Outreach:** We share insights, guidelines, and templates to help new builders get started with AI agents. We also host discussions and community events to inspire collaboration.

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions of code, documentation, research links, and ideas. To contribute, fork one of our repositories or open an issue to start a conversation. Whether you're an experienced engineer or just curious about agentic AI, there's a place for you in our community.

✨ **Together, let's build AI that empowers everyone.**
